The obstacles are filled rectangles of unknown dimensions and can be found anywhere in the maize.  The robot cannot be in those cells. There are 3 actions allowed. Up one cell (cost is 1), right one cell  (cost is 3), diagonally up towards the right (cost is 2). The system should output: 1. The complete path if goal is found otherwise show pathâ€™s followed by algorithm to search for  goal 2. The sequence of actions performed to reach the goal from start 3. The total cost of the path 4. A grid which shows the path followed.
